        </map>

        <p>In the following we will go through the features of YUView based on the GUI modules you can see in the image above. Just click on one of the modules to jump directly it it's description.</p>

        <h3>
            <a id="ViewAndNavigation" class="anchor" href="#ViewAndNavigation" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>YUV View and Navigation
        </h3>

        <p>At it's core YUView is a powerful YUV file viewer. This includes various features you are probably familiar with from other media playses like: play, pause, stop and a slider to navigate the sequence. Press the space bar to toggle play/pause, and use the repeat modes (repeat playlist, repeat one sequence, play playlist once).</p>

        <p>The center viewer shows the item that is currently selected in the <a href="#playlist">playlist</a>. Press and hold the right or center mouse button to pan the video in the viewer. For a closer look you can zoom into the sequence by selecting the desired area, using the mouse wheel or pressing '+' or '-' on the keyboard.</p>

        <h3>
            <a id="playlist" class="anchor" href="#playlist" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Playlist
        </h3>

        <p> The playlist holds a list of sequences that can be played after each other. Use the open button or just drop supported files here. However, this is not the only thing the playlist can be used for. Are you comparing multiple versions of the same sequence? Use the keyboards 'up' and 'down' arrows in the center view to move the selection in the playlist up and down. Did you start an analysis and you want to work on it later? You don't have to search for all sequences and files that you had opened last time. YUView can save a playlist with all sequences and their settings in a playlist file.</p>

        <p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IENT/YUView/gh-pages/images/DifferenceView.png" alt="YUView difference view - get difference between two sequences in different quality or an original to other information (here original sequence with its residuum). Select two videos and combine them to a difference view."></p>

        <p>If you want to directly see what the difference between two sequences is, YUView can display difference frames. For that, select two videos of your playlist, right click on them and choose 'Add Difference Sequence'. The new item shows you the pixel wise difference of the two attached sequences.</p>

        <p>If you want to perform a visual test, where participants are asked to rate a set of sequences, text fields in between the sequences come in handy. Just right click on the playlist and select 'Add Text Frame'. You can customize these to your liking and save them alongside your playlist.</p>

        <h3>
            <a id="statistics" class="anchor" href="#statistics" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Statistics
        </h3>

        <p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IENT/YUView/gh-pages/images/Statistics.png" alt="YUView statistics with grid and zoom box"></p>

        <p>In YUView, you can add a statistics overlay to your video. This could be data generated by an encoder/decoder (block size, prediction modes, motion information) or other information generated by a separate process. For this purpose we defined a ".csv" file format that carries information (values or vectors) on a block basis. These files can be loaded in YUView and dropped onto a video sequence. YUView then renders the values from the csv file as colored blocks or vectors over the video sequence.</p>
        
        <p>For example if you have a video decoder of some sort, you can write a function that writes out a value per block. This information can then be quickly visualized in YUView. A definition of the csv file can be found in our <a href="https://github.com/IENT/YUView/wiki">wiki</a>.</p>

        <h3>
            <a id="fileoptions" class="anchor" href="#fileoptions" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>File Options
        </h3>

        <p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IENT/YUView/gh-pages/images/FileOptions.png" alt="YUView file options - here you can set the display width, height, frame rate, pixel format and more."></p>

        <p>You have small frame sizes and/or 4k sequences? No problem. YUView has no built in limit on the frame size. And even if you have a non standard frame size, you can customize your frame width and height just like the frame rate via several boxes.</p>

        <p>YUView supports various pixel formats like 4:0:0 8-bit, 4:2:0 Y'CbCr 8-bit planar, 4:2:2 Y'CrCb 8-bit planar, 4:4:4 Y'CbCr 12-bit LE planar, RGB 8-bit and GBR 12-bit planar just to name a few. A complete list of all supported formats can be found in our <a href="https://github.com/IENT/YUView/wiki">wiki</a>.</p>

        <h3>
            <a id="displayoptions" class="anchor" href="#displayoptions" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Display Options
        </h3>

        <p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IENT/YUView/gh-pages/images/ComparisonView.png" alt="YUView comparison view - compare two sequences (here, an original sequence and its residuum). Ability to drag the vertical line to the left and the right."></p>

        <p>Are you comparing two video sequences and are you looking for a better way then switching between the two sequences? YUView offers the option to display two videos either in split view or in comparison view. In split view, the two videos are shown in full scale side by side. You can navigate and zoom into both videos just like you could before. In comparison view, both videos are laid out on top of each other, with the view divided by a vertical bar. Right of this bar you can see the one video, on the left, the other video is displayed so you can spot the differences easier. The vertical bar can be moved to the left or right, so you can compare different frame parts of these videos. Simply select two videos in your <a href="#playlist">playlist</a> and set the checkbox "Split- and Comparison View". Now choose either 'comparison' or 'split view' from the dropdown menu.</p>

        <p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IENT/YUView/gh-pages/images/ZoomBox.png" alt="YUView zoom box - a feature to get further information about a selected pixel (coordinates and statistics value if avaiable). You select a pixel by dragging your mouse over the frame."></p>

        <p>If you work with decoders or pixel manipulators, you want to know what happens in each block or pixel of your frames. For this, YUView has two features to assist you: a pixel grid and a zoom box. The pixel grid overlays your frame with horizontal and vertical lines in a user defined spacing. The zoom box makes it even more exact. If activated, you can scroll over each pixel of your frame and the zoom box will show you a highly magnified version of the selected pixel and it's surrouding. It will also tell you the exact pixel coordinates and the corresponding pixel Y, U and V values. If you are using <a href="#statistics">statistics </a>, the values of all visible statics will be listed.</p>

        <h3>
            <a id="yuvoptions" class="anchor" href="#yuvoptions" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>YUV Options
        </h3>

        <p>YUView is highly flexible when reading YUV files. In this window you can modify the used scales for luma and chroma values and offsets. You can also specify which components to display and which interpolation and color conversion method to use.</p>

        <p>Thanks to the <a href="http://www.libde265.org/">libde265</a> library, YUView can directly decode and display H.265/HEVC encoded binary bitstreams. We even get decoding information directly from the decoder and generate statistics which you can directly view in YUView. Ever wanted to see what is happening when decoding an H.265/HEVC bitstream? Just open it, select a statistic and navigate the sequence. More information can be found in our <a href="https://github.com/IENT/YUView/wiki/H265-HEVC-decoding-with-libde265">wiki</a></p>
