<a id="welcome-to-yuview" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-yuview" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to YUView</h3>

<p>YUView is a YUV player with an advanced analytic toolset for Linux, Windows and Mac based on Qt. It can show YUV sequences in several YUV formats and supports zooming, easy navigation through the video, side by side view, comparison view, calculation of differences, playlists and more. On this page we will present some of the supported features. Further information can be found in our <a href="https://github.com/IENT/YUView/wiki">wiki</a>.</p>

<h3>
<a id="getting-started" class="anchor" href="#getting-started" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Getting started</h3>

<p>In order to run YUView, you can either get a precompiled binary or you can easily compile YUView yourself. To compile YUView, you need to have Qt (&gt; 5.0, 64bit) installed on your PC. Download the <a href="https://github.com/IENT/YUView">YUView source files</a> and open the .pro file with Qt Creator. Now, just build and run YUView. Both MinGW64 and the VS2013 compilers are tested.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IENT/YUView/gh-pages/images/Overwiev.png" alt="YUView overview - this is the main window of our program. The currently selected sequence can be seen in the center."></p>

<h3>
<a id="sequence-customization-and-navigation" class="anchor" href="#sequence-customization-and-navigation" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Sequence customization and navigation</h3>

<p>In its primary use, YUView is a common YUV player with all typical functionalities - just like you know it from other media players: play, stop, pause, which can be accessed by pressing the spacebar for ease of use. Additionally, you can navigate to each frame with a slider, enter the number directly into a box or use the left and right arrow keys. If you want to repeat a sequence or playlist indefinitely, you can choose between "Repeat", "Repeat All" and of course "Repeat Off", just with a single click.</p>

<h3>
<a id="display-your-sequence" class="anchor" href="#display-your-sequence" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Display your sequence</h3>

<p>With this program you can load more than one video and switch between them by using the up and down arrow keys. YUView supports various pixel formats like 4:0:0 8-bit, 4:2:0 Y'CbCr 8-bit planar, 4:2:2 Y'CrCb 8-bit planar, 4:4:4 Y'CbCr 12-bit LE planar, RGB 8-bit and GBR 12-bit planar just to name some of them. We also support different color conversions according to ITU-R Recommendations BT.601, BT.709 and BT.2020. A list of all supported formats can be found in our <a href="https://github.com/IENT/YUView/wiki">wiki</a>.</p>

<p>You have small, uncommon or odd frame sizes and/or 4k sequences? No problem! YUView has no built in limit on the frame size. And even if you have a non-standard frame size, you can customize your frame width and height just like the frame rate via several boxes.</p>

<p>YUView also offers the opportunity to inspect a single color component by an easy dropdown menu, if you need to see either luminance only or one of the chrominance components. You can also scale and offset the luminance or chrominance component for further customization. For a closer look, you can zoom into the sequence by selecting the desired area, using the mouse wheel or pressing '+' or '-'.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IENT/YUView/gh-pages/images/FileOptions.png" alt="YUView file options - here you can set the display width, height, frame rate, pixel format and more."></p>

<h3>
<a id="overlay-statistics" class="anchor" href="#overlay-statistics" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Overlay statistics</h3>

<p>In YUView, you can display additional statistics as an overlay on top of your video. This could be data generated by an encoder/decoder (block size, prediction modes, motion information) or other information generated by a separate process. For this purpose, we define a ".csv" file format that carries information on a block basis for a video sequence. These files can be loaded in YUView and dropped onto a video sequence to show the overlay. A definition of the csv file can be found in our <a href="https://github.com/IENT/YUView/wiki">wiki</a>.</p>

<h3>
<a id="see-every-pixel" class="anchor" href="#see-every-pixel" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>See every pixel</h3>

<p>If you work with decoders or pixel manipulators, you want to know what happens in each block of your frames. For this, YUView has two features to help you with that: a pixel grid and a zoom box. The pixel grid overlays your frame with horizontal and vertical lines in a user defined spacing. The zoom box makes it even more exact. If activated, you can scroll over each pixel of your frame and the zoom box will show you the coordinates, YUV component value  and, if you have some statistics activated for this sequence, the value of the currently selected pixel alongside a small area around this pixel.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IENT/YUView/gh-pages/images/ZoomBox.png" alt="YUView zoom box - a feature to get further information about a selected pixel such as coordinates and statistics value if avaiable. You select a pixel by moving your mouse over the frame."></p>

<h3>
<a id="sequence-comparison" class="anchor" href="#sequence-comparison" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Sequence comparison</h3>

<p>Compare two videos with different quality levels visually? YUView offers the opportunity to display two videos either in split or in comparison view. In split view, the two videos are shown in full scale side by side. You can navigate and zoom into both videos just like you did before. In comparison view, frames are shown in the same resolution, divided by a vertical bar in the middle. Right of this bar you can see the first video and on the left side, the other video is displayed. This way you can spot differences easily. The vertical bar can be moved to the left or right, so you can compare different frame parts of the video sequences. 
To activate the sequence comparison, simply select two videos of your playlist and set the checkbox "Split- and Comparison View". Now you can select either choose "Side-By-Side" or "Comparison" in the dropdown menu.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IENT/YUView/gh-pages/images/ComparisonView.png" alt="YUView comparison view - compare two sequences: here, an original sequence and its residual signal. You can drag the vertical line to the left and right to uncover more of each sequence."></p>

<h3>
<a id="see-the-difference" class="anchor" href="#see-the-difference" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>See the difference</h3>

<p>If you want to directly see what the exact, per-pixel difference between two sequences is, YUView can generate difference frames. To do that, select two videos of your playlist, right click on them and choose 'Add Difference Sequence'. Now you can visually spot differences of your two sequences directly in a video. Note that you can also change the luminance scale or offset to amplify differences which are hard to spot!</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IENT/YUView/gh-pages/images/DifferenceView.png" alt="YUView difference view - get difference between two sequences in different quality or an original to other information (here original sequence with its residuum). Select two videos and combine them to a difference view."></p>

<h3>
<a id="dont-lose-time" class="anchor" href="#dont-lose-time" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Don't lose time</h3>

<p>You started an analysis and want to work on it later? You don't have to look for all sequences and files that you had last time. YUView can create and save your current playlist and all its current settings you chose in a playlist file. Use File-&gt;Save Playlist, enter a name and next time you need this playlist, simply reopen it via drag &amp; drop.</p>
