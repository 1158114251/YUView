  // QDockWidget. Also to a custom QDockWidget which might not need this. The UI code adds this widget after the 
  // contructor of this class has been called, so if you do setWidget() in the constructor your widget will be overwritten
  // by the UI. This function will catch the UI's call to setWidget and ignore it.
