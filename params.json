{"name":"Yuview","tagline":"YUV viewer and analysis tool","body":"###Welcome to YUView\r\nYUView is a YUV player with an advanced analytic toolset for Linux and Windows based on Qt. With this program you can show YUV sequences in several pixel formats, zoom into each frame, navigate through the whole video, indicate decoder or other frame information, display two videos in comparison view and so on. On this page we will present you some of the supported features. Further information can be found in our [wiki](https://github.com/IENT/YUView/wiki).\r\n\r\n###Getting stated\r\nTo run YUView, you need to have Qt Creator installed on your pc. After that, download the [YUView source files](https://github.com/IENT/YUView) and open the .pro file with Qt Creator. Now, just build and run YUView.\r\n\r\n![YUView overwiev - this is the main window of our program. In the center is the currently selected sequence.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IENT/YUView/gh-pages/images/Overwiev.png)\r\n\r\n###Sequence customization and navigation\r\nAs a primary use, YUView is a common YUV player with all its functionalities just like you know it from VLC media player: play, stop, pause, which can be accessed by pressing the spacebar for an easy use. Additionally you can get to each frame with a slider or enter the number directly in a box. The repetition of a sequence can be done with a single click.\r\n\r\n###Display your sequence\r\nWith this program you can load more than one video and switch between them by using arrow buttons. YUView supports various pixel formats like 4:0:0 8-bit, 4:2:0 Y'CbCr 8-bit planar, 4:2:2 Y'CrCb 8-bit planar, 4:4:4 Y'CbCr 12-bit LE planar, RGB 8-bit and GBR 12-bit planar just to name some of them. A list of all supported formats can be found in our [wiki](https://github.com/IENT/YUView/wiki).\r\n\r\nYou have small frame sizes and/or 4k sequences? No problem. YUView can show QCif up to 4k sequences and even if you have a non standard frame size, you can customize your frame width and height just like the frame rate via several boxes.\r\n\r\nYUView also offers the opportunity to select a single color component by an easy dropdown menu, if you need to see either luma only or one of the chroma components only. For a closer look you can zoom into your sequence by selecting the desired area, using the mouse wheel or pressing '+' or '-'.\r\n\r\n![YUView file options - here you can set the display width, height, frame rate, pixel format and more.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IENT/YUView/gh-pages/images/FileOptions.png)\r\n\r\n###Show more information\r\nIn YUView, you can add further information to your video like decoder residua, prediction modes, motion vectors for each prediction block in each frame. With the Zoom Box and a grid for all blocks it is easy to visualize all information you need. How your statistics file needs to look like can be found in our [wiki](https://github.com/IENT/YUView/wiki). Simply add the file to the playlist and drag&drop them on the right sequence.\r\n\r\n![YUView statistics with grid and zoom box](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IENT/YUView/gh-pages/images/Statistics.png)\r\n\r\n###See every pixel\r\nIf you work with decoders or pixel manipulators, you want to know what happens in each block of your frames. For this, YUView has two features to help you with that: a pixel grid and a zoom box. The pixel grid overlays your frame with horizontal and vertical lines in a user defined spacing. The zoom box makes it even more exact. By activation, you can scroll over each pixel of your frame and the zoom box will show you the coordinate and, if you have some statistics of this sequence, the value of the currently selected pixel beside a small area around this pixel.\r\n![YUView zoom box - a feature to get further information about a selected pixel (coordinates and statistics value if avaiable). You select a pixel by dragging your mouse over the frame.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IENT/YUView/gh-pages/images/ZoomBox.png)\r\n\r\n###Sequence comparison \r\nCompare two videos with different quality levels visually? YUView offers the opportunity to display two videos either in  split or in comparison view. In split view, the two videos are shown in full scale side by side. You can navigate and zoom into both videos just like you did before. In comparison view, frames are shown in one resolution, divided by a vertical bar. Right of this bar you can see the one video, on the left, the other video is displayed so you can spot the differences easier. The vertical bar can be moved to the left or right, so you can compare different frame parts of these videos. \r\nTo do one of these views, simply select two videos of your playlist and set the checkbox \"Split- and Comarison View\". Now you can select either comparison or split view in the dropdown menu.\r\n![YUView comparison view - compare two sequences (here, an original sequence and its residuum). Ability to drag the vertical line to the left and the right.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IENT/YUView/gh-pages/images/ComparisonView.png)\r\n\r\n###See the difference\r\nIf you want to see directly what the difference between your two sequences is, YUView can display difference frames. For that, select two videos of your playlist, right click on them and choose 'Add Difference Sequence'. Now you can visually spot differences of your two sequences directly in a video.\r\n![YUView difference view - get difference between two sequences in different quality or an original to other information (here original sequence with its residuum). Select two videos and combine them to a difference view.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IENT/YUView/gh-pages/images/DifferenceView.png)\r\n###Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with this project?
