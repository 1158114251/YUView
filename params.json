{"name":"YUView","tagline":"YUV Viewer and Analysis Tool","body":"###Welcome to YUView\r\nYUView is a YUV player with an advanced analytic toolset for Linux, Windows and Mac based on Qt. It can show YUV sequences in several YUV formats and supports zooming, easy navigation through the video, side by side view, comparison view, calculation of differences, playlists and more. On this page we will present some of the supported features. Further information can be found in our [wiki](https://github.com/IENT/YUView/wiki).\r\n\r\n###Getting stated\r\nIn order to run YUView you can either get a precompiled binary or you can easily compile YUView yourself. To compile YUView, you need to have Qt (> 5.0, 64bit) installed on your pc. After that, download the [YUView source files](https://github.com/IENT/YUView) and open the .pro file with Qt Creator. Now, just build and run YUView. Both the MinGW64 and the VS2013 compilers are tested.\r\n\r\n![YUView overwiev - this is the main window of our program. In the center is the currently selected sequence.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IENT/YUView/gh-pages/images/Overwiev.png)\r\n\r\n###Sequence customization and navigation\r\nAs a primary use, YUView is a common YUV player with all its functionalities just like you know it from other media player: play, stop, pause, which can be accessed by pressing the spacebar for an easy use. Additionally you can get to each frame with a slider or enter the number directly in a box. The repetition of a sequence can be done with a single click.\r\n\r\n###Display your sequence\r\nWith this program you can load more than one video and switch between them by using arrow buttons. YUView supports various pixel formats like 4:0:0 8-bit, 4:2:0 Y'CbCr 8-bit planar, 4:2:2 Y'CrCb 8-bit planar, 4:4:4 Y'CbCr 12-bit LE planar, RGB 8-bit and GBR 12-bit planar just to name some of them. A list of all supported formats can be found in our [wiki](https://github.com/IENT/YUView/wiki).\r\n\r\nYou have small frame sizes and/or 4k sequences? No problem. YUView has no built in limit on the frame size. And even if you have a non standard frame size, you can customize your frame width and height just like the frame rate via several boxes.\r\n\r\nYUView also offers the opportunity to inspect a single color component by an easy dropdown menu, if you need to see either luma only or one of the chroma components only. For a closer look you can zoom into your sequence by selecting the desired area, using the mouse wheel or pressing '+' or '-'.\r\n\r\n![YUView file options - here you can set the display width, height, frame rate, pixel format and more.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IENT/YUView/gh-pages/images/FileOptions.png)\r\n\r\n###Overlayer statistics\r\nIn YUView, you can overlay additional statistics over you video. This could be data generated by an encoder/decoder (block size, prediction modes, motion information) or other information generated by a separate process. For this purpose we define a \".csv\" file format that carries information on a block basis for a video sequence. These files can be loaded in YUView and dropped onto a video sequence to show the overlay. A definition of the csv file can be found in our [wiki](https://github.com/IENT/YUView/wiki).\r\n\r\n![YUView statistics with grid and zoom box](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IENT/YUView/gh-pages/images/Statistics.png)\r\n\r\n###See every pixel\r\nIf you work with decoders or pixel manipulators, you want to know what happens in each block of your frames. For this, YUView has two features to help you with that: a pixel grid and a zoom box. The pixel grid overlays your frame with horizontal and vertical lines in a user defined spacing. The zoom box makes it even more exact. If activated, you can scroll over each pixel of your frame and the zoom box will show you the coordinate and, if you have some statistics of this sequence, the value of the currently selected pixel alongside a small area around this pixel.\r\n![YUView zoom box - a feature to get further information about a selected pixel (coordinates and statistics value if avaiable). You select a pixel by dragging your mouse over the frame.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IENT/YUView/gh-pages/images/ZoomBox.png)\r\n\r\n###Sequence comparison \r\nCompare two videos with different quality levels visually? YUView offers the opportunity to display two videos either in  split or in comparison view. In split view, the two videos are shown in full scale side by side. You can navigate and zoom into both videos just like you did before. In comparison view, frames are shown in one resolution, divided by a vertical bar. Right of this bar you can see the one video, on the left, the other video is displayed so you can spot the differences easier. The vertical bar can be moved to the left or right, so you can compare different frame parts of these videos. \r\nTo do one of these views, simply select two videos of your playlist and set the checkbox \"Split- and Comarison View\". Now you can select either comparison or split view in the dropdown menu.\r\n![YUView comparison view - compare two sequences (here, an original sequence and its residuum). Ability to drag the vertical line to the left and the right.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IENT/YUView/gh-pages/images/ComparisonView.png)\r\n\r\n###See the difference\r\nIf you want to directly see what the difference between two sequences is, YUView can display difference frames. For that, select two videos of your playlist, right click on them and choose 'Add Difference Sequence'. Now you can visually spot differences of your two sequences directly in a video.\r\n![YUView difference view - get difference between two sequences in different quality or an original to other information (here original sequence with its residuum). Select two videos and combine them to a difference view.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IENT/YUView/gh-pages/images/DifferenceView.png)\r\n\r\n###Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with this project?
