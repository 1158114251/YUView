            <h1>YUView Help</h1>
            <p>Welcome to YUView. At it's core, YUView is a platform independent powerful viewer and player of raw video files in the YUV format. A multitude of different YUV formats as well as different conversions to RGB are supported. Furthermore, YUView supports raw RGB files, various types of image sequences, coded HEVC files, an overlay of statistics, comparison tools and the list goes on.</p>
            <p>In the following, we want to provide an overview of YUView and all of its features as well as some valuable hints:</p>

            </center>

            <p>The main window of YUView is organized around one central view where the video and other items are displayed. Around this central widget, there are several dockable panels that provide various functions. All panels are freely movable and un-dockable. (<b>Hint:</b> The default layout of the dockable panels can be restored under Help->Reset Window Layout) In the following we will go into detail on the central view and the panels one by one:</p>

            <h3>1.1. The central view and the Display Options Panel</h3>
            <p>Everything in YUView revolves around the central view. Here, the item that is currently selected in the playlist is shown. Use the left mouse button to drag the view and the right mouse button to zoom into a specific region in the item. Furthermore, you can zoom in and out using the mouse wheel or the '+' and '-' buttons. Use Ctl+F or double click the view to put it into full screen mode. Some more features of the central view can be controlled in the display options panel:</p>

            <ol>
                <li><b>Split- and comparison view:</b> This feature enables the direct comparison of two items. Activate the split and select two items in the playlist. A vertical line will split the view into two parts. This split line can be moved with the mouse. The two items will be shown each on one of the two sides. There are two modes how the items can be arranged:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Side-By-Side:</b> The two items are shown next to each other so that the same region of each item is shown in it's corresponding view. This way, the same region in two items can be directly compared.</li>
                    <li><b>Comparison:</b> In comparison mode, the two items are placed at the same position (on top of each other) and the vertical split line can be used to switch between the two items.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><b>Separate View:</b> The separate view enables an additional windows, which has an identical sibling to the central view in the main view. It has the same features as the other central view (moving, zooming, splitting, going to full screen...). You can link the two views by activating <b>Link Views</b>. If active, both views will always show the same section of the item(s). All operations (moving, zooming etc.) will also show in the other view. This mode is great for presenting with two computer screens. Put the separate view on the external screen and keep full control on the primary screen. For performance reasons, playback only runs on the separate view. Activate <b>Playback in primary view</b> to enable playback in both views.</li>
                <li><b>Draw Grid:</b> Draw a regular grid on top of the item with the given distance (in pixels) between grid lines. The color of the lines can be changed in the settings dialog.</li>
                <li><b>Zoom Box:</b> The zoom box is an overlay in the bottom right of the central view that provides a magnification as well as detailed information about the pixel currently under the mouse cursor. If present, it also gives information about the shown statistics values.</li>
            </ol>

            <p><b>Hint 1:</b> You can reset the central view by pressing Ctrl+0<br />
            <b>Hint 2:</b> The central view supports touch navigation and touch gestures (3 finger horizontal to switch frames, 3 finger vertical to switch sequences)</p>

            <h3>1.2. The Playlist Panel</h3>
            <p>The playlist contains a list of items that will be played back from top to bottom (if the repeat mode is set to repeat all of course). This can be files that were opened (like YUV or HEVC files) or other special types. Within the playlist you can rearrange items by dragging them around. Some special items also allow other items to be dropped onto them. Items can be added by opening a file (File->Open, Right mouse click onto the playlist or the button underneath the playlist) or right clicking onto the playlist and creating one of the special items:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Text frame:</b> A text frame renders a text in the middle of the screen for a specific amount of time. This is very helpful for visual tests or for demonstrations to indicate what is going to be displayed next. In combination with an overlay, it can render additional information on top or next to a video.<br /><b>Hint:</b> The text frame understands HTML syntax.</li>
                <li><b>Difference Sequence:</b> A difference sequence can calculate and display the pixel wise difference between two items. If both items are YUV files, the difference will be calculated directly in the YUV domain. Information on the calculation can be found in the info panel. Just drop two files onto this item to calculate the difference. The difference can be amplified by the amplification factor in the properties panel.<br /><b>Hint:</b> Activate the zoom box to inspect the original values of both items and the difference value.</li>
                <li><b>Overlay:</b> An overlay just draws all the items that it contains on top of each other in the order they are in the playlist. Drop two or more items onto the overlay to show them both. The alignment of the imtes can be set in the properties panel.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>1.3. The Properties Panel</h3>
            <p>The properties panel can be used to change the properties of the currently selected item. The controls in this panel depend on the kind of item that is currently being selected. The specific controls are explained later but the controls that most items have in common are explained here.</p>
            
            <p>Firstly, all items that are index by frames (like a video or image sequence) offer the following controls:</p>

            <!--The properties controls for every item that is indexed by frame-->
            <center>
                <img style="margin:20px;" text-align="center" src=":/help_PropertiesIndexed.png" />
            </center>

            <p>The start and end frame controls can be used to display only a subset of all frames in the sequence. E.g. you could select to only display the first 100 frames. The navigation bar will change accordingly. The rate control will set the desired playback rate. YUView will try to get as close as possible to this rate. If playback is too slow, try to increase/activate the cache. Finally, the sampling control can be set to only display every n'th frame in the sequence.<p/>
            <p>With the second set of controls, the Frame size (width and heighe) of the sequence can be changed. The size can either be defined freely or the frame size dropdown offers a set of commonly used video sizes.</p>
            <p>All items that are shown statically for a certain amount of time (like text items or images) do not offer these controls. Instead a duration control allows you to control the time that the item is displayed for if playback is running.</p>
            
            <h3>1.4. The Navigation Bar</h3>
            <p>The navigation bar at the bottom of the window is similar to the navigation bars known from other media players. Playback can be started, paused and stopped. There is a horizontal slider and a spin box next to it for navigation within the selected sequence. When playback is running, the label next to the spin box will inform you about the currentky drawn frame rate. Lastly, the repeat mode can be switched using the button on the right:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Repeat Off:</b> Repeat is off. When the end of the current item is reached, the next item in the playlist will be played. If the last frame of the last item in the playlist is reached, playback is stopped.</li>
                <li><b>Repeat One:</b> Repeat the currently selected item. If the end of the current item is reached, playbac will start over at the beginning of the currently selected item.</li>
                <li><b>Repeat All:</b> Repeat the entire playlist. When the end of the current item is reached, the next item in the playlist will be played. If the last frame of the last item in the playlist is reached, playback will continue with the first item in the playlist.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>1.5. The Info Panel</h3>
            <p>The info panel provied additional inforamtion on the item that is currently selected in the playlist. It sometimes also provieds warnings.</p>

            <h2 id="refFormats">2. Supported File Formats</h2>
            <p>YUView supports a wide variety of file formats. Just use the File->Open dialog to load the files into the playlist.</p>

            <h3>2.1 YUV Files</h3>
            <p>Firstly, YUView of course supports raw YUV formats with a wide range of supsamplings, bit depths and packing options.</p>

            <!--The YUV specific properties controls in the properties panel-->
            <center>
                <img style="margin:20px;" text-align="center" src=":/help_PropertiesYUView.png" />
            </center>

            <!--The dialog for custom YUV formats-->
            <center>
                <img style="margin:20px;" text-align="center" src=":/help_PropertiesYUViewCustom.png" />
            </center>

            <h3>2.2 RGB Files</h3>
            <p>Another raw format that YUView supports are raw data in the RGB format.</p>

            <h3>2.3 Image files and Image Sequences</h3>
            <p></p>
            
            <h3>2.4 Statistics Files (csv)</h3>
            <p></p>

            <h3>2.5 HEVC Files</h3>
            <p></p>
